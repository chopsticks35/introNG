in english, we write SENTENCES, composed of WORDS, which have TYPES (noun, verb)
in javascript, we write STATEMENTS, which are composed (mostly) of VALUES, which have TYPES (number, string)

Operators - tokens that let you combine 1, 2, or 3 values into a new value

variables - a name that refers to a value
Use the 'var' keyword, name the variable, use the assignment operator, and then the value to assign. 
Variable names must contain only letters, numbers, $, and _.  They cannot start with a number.
var 2fast2furious // not VALID
var $$billz  // IS valid



PRIMITIVE types

Number
number operators: +, -, *, /, %
++, --, +=

FizzBuzz
Print the numbers from 1 - 15.

If the number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead.
If the number is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz' instead.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead.


String
string operators: + concatenation
The + operator is overloaded, meaning it behaves differently depending on the types of its OPERANDS. For numbers, it performs addition, but for strings, it performs concatenation.

If you use operators to combine values of different types, their types will be COERCED to the same type. 


Strings have properties -  additional values that belong to the string
length - the length of the string
numerical indexes - individual characters of the string
Strings are 0-indexed. The first character is index 0, the second is index 1, etc. 


Boolean
only 2 possible values: true, false

Boolean operators
! - the NOT operator is a UNARY operator, meaning it takes exactly 1 operand. 

&& - and
|| - or
<, >, ===, ==, !=, <=, >=

if-statements let us conditionally perform a set of instructions if some condition is true
Start with the 'if' keyword. In parentheses, put the if-condition. If the condition is true, execute the code in the braces ( the if-body )
An if-else chain starts with exactly 1 if statement, then has 0-infinite else if statements, and then has 0 or 1 else statement. 



undefined is a type. There is only one value of type undefined: the value undefined.

null is a type. There is only one value of type null: null

every value is either truthy or falsey.
0 and NaN are falsey values. All other numbers are truthey.
'' is a falsey value. All other strings are truthey.
null is falsey.
undefined is falsey.
All other values are truthey.

Non-primitive types


Array
Arrays are lists of values

[].push() add an item to the end of the array



For loops

First thing that happens is the loop initializes ONCE: var i = 0;

At the start of every loop, the loop condition gets evaluated: i < days.length

After every loop, the loop increments is evaluated: i++


Object
An object is a list of key-value pairs. Together, a key-value pair can be called a 'property'


Functions - values that do things

A Method is just a function that belongs to an object.

When a return statement is executed, that ends the function execution.

Built-in methods

Split: turns a string into an array
Split is a non-destructive method, meaning it does not modify the original array.

Join: turns an array into a string

push: adds an element to the end of the array
pop: removes an element from the end of the array
sort: sorts an array.
