What is Angular?
	- A Strongly Opinionated, MVC, Front-End Framework

	* Strongly Opinionated
		- All in one solution
		- Does not play well with others
		- Wants you to do something the 'Angular' way

		- The 'Angular' way isn't always the best solution - sometimes the solution lives outside of Angular

	* Front-End
		- Framework that's concerned with the BROWSER
		- Has ways of interacting with the back-end

	* MVC - Model, View, Controller

		Model : Data that drives your application

		View  : What the user sees (visual representation of the model)

		Controller : Glue between the model and the view

		- Do not directly change the view
			- Change the MODEL and have those changes propagate forward to the view

			- Use DECLARATIVE programming to define relationships between the model and the view

			- Contrasts with IMPERATIVE programming in which you directly manipulate the view with a sequence of commands
